                    ======Program Summary======
    This program plays the game Obstruction. The game requires two players,or one person playing as
    two players,to place X's and O's on the board. The spaces around the X's and O's are filled, marked
    by the & symbol, and the player is unable to place there. The game is over once the board is full and
    the player that filled the board won and the player that is unable to play loses. EXTRAS:For hints the
    player is able to push h and hints will appear as yellow. The game board is colourful,thus it is easy
    to understand what is happening. The rules and info is on the board for help. (3/6 Extras).
        
                    ======Program Organization======
    The Obstruction directory has three sub directories which are bin,include and src. The bin
    directory houses the runMe, the include houses the a1.h and the src houses the a1.c.
